## FUNCTIONALITY SPECS

### Admin ("Staff") Users

- As a "staff" user, I want to manage listings, realtors, contact inquiries, and
  settings for the web app through an admin dashboard.
- As a "staff" user, when I am editing a listing, I want to have the choice of
  setting a listing to "unpublished" so that "nonStaff" users won't be able to
  see the listing until it has been set to the "published" setting.
- As a "staff" user, I want to have the ability to list outstanding real estate
  agents on the About page, under the "Agent of the Month" heading.
- As a "staff" user, when a "nonStaff" user ("registered" & "nonRegistered") has
  submitted a inquiry form to our database, I want to be notified via email.
- As a "staff" user, when a "nonStaff" user clicks the main photo on an
  individual listing page, I want to give the "nonStaff" user the ability to
  view more photos of that listing without having to manually click to scroll
  through them (automatic scrolling).
- As a "staff" user, I want to limit registered "nonStaff" users to only **ONE**
  inquiry submission per listing.

### Registered/Unregistered ("NonStaff") Users

- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, I want to navigate through home
  listings using pagination.
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, I want to have the ability to
  search for home listings on the Search page, as well as on the Home page.
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, I want to be able to search for
  home listings by: keyword, city, state, bedrooms, or price.
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, when I click on a listing, I
  want to be taken to an individual listing page for that specific listing, so I
  can view more in-depth information regarding that listing (i.e. - price,
  bedroooms, bathrooms, etc).
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, when I'm on the individual
  listing page for a listing and I click on the large main photo, I want a new
  window to pop up on my screen that allows me to view more photos of that
  listing.
- As an registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, when I'm on an individual
  listing page, I want to see an inquiry form where I can submit my contact
  information to express my interest in a listing.

### Unregistered ("NonStaff") Users ONLY

- As an _unregistered_ "nonStaff" user, I want to be able to register for an
  account that allows me to track the status of my inquiries and also schedule
  an appointment with my real estate agent.

### Registered ("NonStaff") Users ONLY

- As a _registered_ "nonStaff" user, when I navigate to my user dashboard, I
  want to be able to view the Calendly availability of the listing-specific real
  estate agent via their Calendly page.
