## FUNCTIONALITY SPECS

### Admin ("Staff") Users

- As a "staff" user, I want to manage listings, realtors, contact inquiries, and
  general settings for the web app through an admin dashboard.
- As a "staff" user, when I am editing a listing, I want to have the choice of
  setting a listing to "unpublished" so that "nonStaff" users won't be able to
  see the listing until it has been set to the "published" setting.
- As a "staff" user, I want to have the ability to list outstanding real estate
  agents on the About page, under the "Agent of the Month" heading.
- As a "staff" user, when a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user has
  submitted a inquiry form to our database, I want to be notified via email.
- As a "staff" user, when a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user clicks the
  large main photo on an individual listing page, I want that "nonStaff" user to
  have the ability to view more photos of that listing _without_ having to
  manually scroll through each photo them (carousel-styled automatic scrolling).
- As a "staff" user, I want to limit registered "nonStaff" users to only **ONE**
  inquiry submission per listing.
- As a "staff" user, when I create/edit a listing via my admin dashboard, I want
  to be able to enter the following information for that listing: title,
  address/city/state/zip, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, lot size,
  garage, listing date, real estate agent, main image, and 5 alternate images.

### Registered/Unregistered ("NonStaff") Users

  listings using pagination.

  search for home listings on the Search page, as well as on the Home page.
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, I want to be able to search for
  home listings by: keyword, city, state, bedrooms, or price.
- As a registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, when I click on a listing, I

  listing page for a listing and I click on the large main photo, I want a new
  window to pop up on my screen that allows me to view more photos of that
  listing.
- As an registered/unregistered "nonStaff" user, when I'm on an individual
  listing page, I want to see an inquiry form where I can submit my contact
  information to express my interest in a listing.

### Unregistered ("NonStaff") Users ONLY

  an appointment with my real estate agent.
